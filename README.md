# Project Module 3 _(Final Project)_

## Overview

The goal of this project is to predict the probability to win a _e-sport_ match, in this case _League of Legends_, having as inputs of simulation, teh teams and side of play.
All the data performance was from the worldwide champioships of 2020 year.

## Technical Requirements Used

 - [Results and simulation of a match](https://my.visme.co/view/w4j61pe1-g8n5oppexxz12qvz)
 - was neccesarry to clean the dataset, add certain columns and transform so each row represent a entire match.
 - Apply _heatmap_ & _PCA_ to reduce the importance of our dataset
  - Identify which are the most important features in a game, comparing methods of _feature engineering_ & _xgboost_, this would help us to avoid overfitting in our model.
 - Apply different models so we can view which could help to predict our results.
 - For teh simulation of the match, two different points of view were taken to present results
